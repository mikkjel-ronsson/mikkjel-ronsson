- 👋 Hi, I’m @mikkjel-ronsson
- 👀 I’m interested in ...FINALLY committing to learning web development. Spent too long hating on myself for giving up on it years ago, and I am going to see it through! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Web Development 101 via The Odin Project (have taken course through FreeCodeCamp and a couple of YouTube tutorials, as well as an edX course which broke me)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... mobile-first development, ultimately; but at the moment anything that helps feed my urge to learn well. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... mrmikesnowden@gmail.com
